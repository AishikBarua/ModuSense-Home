## 🧠 Key Concepts Learned

### 1️⃣ What is Hardware?
**Hardware** refers to the physical electronic components that can be seen and touched.

Examples:
- Microcontroller boards (ESP32)
- Sensors
- Wires
- Displays

**Hardware works together with software** to build complete systems.

### 2️⃣ Hardware vs Software

| Hardware | Software |
|--------|---------|
| Physical components | Programs / code |
| Fixed once manufactured | Can be updated |
| Sensors, MCU, boards | Firmware, mobile apps |

In smart home systems, **hardware and software are tightly coupled**.

### 3️⃣ What is an Embedded System?
An **embedded system** is a small computer designed to perform **one specific task continuously**.

Examples:
- Smart lock
- Smart switch
- Microwave controller
- Smart home hub

#### Key Characteristics:
- Low power consumption
- Real-time operation
- Dedicated functionality

Smart home devices are **embedded systems by design**.

### 4️⃣ Microcontroller vs Microprocessor

#### Microprocessor (MPU)
- Contains only the CPU
- Requires external RAM, I/O devices
- Used in PCs and laptops

#### Microcontroller (MCU)
- CPU + RAM + Flash + GPIO on one chip
- Designed for embedded systems
- Low power and cost-effective

📌 **Interview-ready statement:**
> A microcontroller integrates CPU, memory, and I/O peripherals on a single chip, making it ideal for embedded and IoT applications.

### 5️⃣ What is ESP32?
ESP32 is a **powerful microcontroller** widely used in IoT and Smart Home products.

#### ESP32 Features:
- Dual-core CPU
- GPIO pins
- ADC (Analog to Digital Converter)
- Built-in Wi-Fi
- Built-in Bluetooth

#### Why ESP32 is Used in Smart Homes:
- Wireless connectivity
- Low power consumption
- Affordable and scalable
- Industry-accepted

ESP32 acts as the **central brain** of the smart home system.
