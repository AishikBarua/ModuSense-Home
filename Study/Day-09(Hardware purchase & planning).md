# Day 13 — Hardware Purchase & Setup Planning

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of Day 13 was to prepare for the hardware implementation phase by identifying and acquiring the required components for the project.

This marks the transition from **system design** to **physical prototyping**.

---

## 🔧 Hardware Procurement

The following components were selected based on project requirements and expandability:

- ESP32 Development Board (Wi-Fi + Bluetooth)
- Breadboard
- Jumper Wires (Male–Male, Male–Female)
- Temperature & Humidity Sensor (DHT11 / DHT22)
- Analog Gas Sensor (MQ-2)
- Motion Sensor (PIR)
- OLED Display (I2C)

---

## 🧠 Selection Rationale

- ESP32 chosen for integrated connectivity and GPIO support
- Sensors selected to demonstrate analog and digital inputs
- OLED display used for local real-time feedback
- Breadboard used for safe, solder-free prototyping

---

## 📋 Planning Notes

- Hardware setup will begin after component arrival
- Wiring diagrams will be created before physical connection
- Initial testing will be done using Serial Monitor

---

## ✅ Day 13 Status

✔ Hardware identified  
✔ Purchase completed / planned  
✔ Ready for physical implementation
