# 📘 Day 05 – Analog Sensors, ADC Resolution & Real-World Readings

## 📌 Objective
Understand how **analog sensors** work, how the **ESP32 reads analog data using ADC**, and why **sensor readings are not always perfect** in real-world applications.

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Learned

### 1️⃣ What is an Analog Sensor?
An **analog sensor** produces a **continuous voltage output** that changes according to a physical condition.

Common examples:
- Temperature sensor
- Gas sensor
- Light sensor (LDR)

Example:
Low level → 0.4V
Medium → 1.7V
High level → 3.0V
