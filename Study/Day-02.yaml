#### 🟢 Analog Signals
- Continuous range of values
- Represent real-world variations

Examples:
- Temperature level
- Gas concentration
- Light intensity

### Signal Comparison

| Digital Signal | Analog Signal |
|--------------|---------------|
| Discrete values (0/1) | Continuous values |
| Simple | More detailed |
| Uses GPIO | Uses ADC |

### 5️⃣ GPIO (General Purpose Input Output)

**GPIO pins** are configurable pins on a microcontroller that allow it to interact with the physical world.

#### GPIO Modes:
| Mode | Description |
|----|------------|
| INPUT | Reads sensor data |
| OUTPUT | Controls devices |
| INPUT_PULLUP | Input with internal resistor |

Examples:
- PIR motion sensor → GPIO INPUT
- LED or relay → GPIO OUTPUT

📌 Interview-ready statement:
> GPIO pins are programmable pins used to read inputs from sensors and control outputs like LEDs and relays.
