Analog sensors represent **real-world variations**, not just ON/OFF states.

### 2️⃣ Why ADC is Required
Microcontrollers like the ESP32 **cannot process voltage directly**.

An **ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter)** converts analog voltage into a **digital number**.

ESP32 ADC:
- 12-bit resolution
- Digital range: `0 – 4095`

---

### 3️⃣ ADC Resolution & Accuracy
**ADC resolution** determines how precisely voltage changes can be measured.

Example:
1.65V ≈ 2048 (12-bit ADC)


Higher resolution:
- Detects smaller changes
- Improves accuracy

📌 Interview-ready statement:
> ADC resolution defines the smallest voltage difference that can be detected by the system.

### 4️⃣ Real-World Analog Sensors

#### Gas Sensor (MQ Series)
- Outputs analog voltage
- Used for gas leakage detection
- Requires calibration

#### Temperature Sensor (Analog Type)
- Voltage varies with temperature
- Sensitive to noise

#### Light Sensor (LDR)
- Resistance changes with light
- Converted to voltage using a resistor

📌 Important Insight:
> Real-world analog sensors are noisy and require filtering and calibration.

### 5️⃣ Threshold-Based Decision Making
Smart home systems rarely use raw ADC values directly.

Example threshold logic:
ADC < 1500 → Safe
ADC > 3000 → Alert


This enables:
- Automation
- Alerts
- Safety mechanisms

---

## 🏠 Smart Home Context
Example: Gas leakage detection system

Gas Sensor → ADC → ESP32 Processing → Alert / Notification


Thresholds convert sensor data into meaningful actions.

## 🚀 Next Step (Day 06 Preview)
On **Day 06**, I will learn:
- Communication protocols (UART, I2C, SPI)
- Which devices use which protocol
- Why protocol selection matters in modular systems
