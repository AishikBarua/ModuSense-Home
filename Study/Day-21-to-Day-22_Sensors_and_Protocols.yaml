Higher voltage = higher ADC reading.

#### 2️⃣ Digital Sensors
- Output only two states:
  - LOW (0V)
  - HIGH (3.3V)

**Examples:**
- PIR motion sensor
- Button
- IR obstacle sensor

These are read using **GPIO digital input pins**.

---

### ESP32 Pin Understanding

Not all ESP32 pins are the same.

- **Digital Input Pins:** Most GPIO pins
- **Analog Input Pins (ADC):** Typically GPIO 32–39

**Interview-ready statement:**
> “For analog sensors, I use ADC-capable GPIO pins on ESP32.”

---

### Pull-Up / Pull-Down Resistors

Input pins can float and cause unstable readings.

Solutions:
- Pull-up resistor → default HIGH
- Pull-down resistor → default LOW

ESP32 provides **internal pull-up resistors**, which are commonly used for buttons and digital sensors.

Example:
```cpp
pinMode(GPIO_NUM, INPUT_PULLUP);
Day-21 Interview Questions & Answers

Q: What is a sensor?
A: A sensor converts a physical parameter like temperature or gas into an electrical signal that a microcontroller can read.

Q: Difference between analog and digital sensors?
A: Analog sensors provide variable voltage values, while digital sensors provide only HIGH or LOW signals.

Q: Does ESP32 understand temperature directly?
A: No. ESP32 understands voltage and digital signals. Sensors convert temperature into voltage.

Q: Why are pull-up resistors used?
A: To avoid floating inputs and ensure stable digital readings.

🔹 Day 22: Communication & Sensor Protocols
Why Protocols Are Needed

Protocols define:

How data is transmitted

Timing and synchronization

Who sends and who receives

Data format

Interview sentence (memorize):

“Protocols define how data is formatted, transmitted, and synchronized between devices.”

Communication Protocols Overview
1️⃣ Analog (ADC)

Single wire

Variable voltage

Simple but noisy

Use case: Gas, light, temperature sensors

2️⃣ Digital GPIO

HIGH or LOW

Simple trigger-based communication

Use case: Motion sensors, buttons

3️⃣ I2C (Very Important)

Two wires:

SDA (data)

SCL (clock)

Multiple devices on same bus

Each device has a unique address

Use case:

Temperature & humidity sensors

OLED displays

RTC modules

Key concept (must memorize):

One I2C bus can connect multiple devices using addresses.

4️⃣ SPI

High-speed communication

More wires (MOSI, MISO, SCK, CS)

Master–slave architecture

Use case:

Displays

SD cards

High-speed peripherals

5️⃣ UART

Two wires (TX, RX)

Point-to-point communication

Use case:

GPS

Debug logs

Bluetooth modules

ESP32 supports multiple UART interfaces.

Day-22 Interview Questions & Answers

Q: Difference between I2C and SPI?
A: I2C uses fewer wires and supports multiple devices, while SPI is faster but requires more pins.

Q: Why not use analog for all sensors?
A: Analog signals are more sensitive to noise and less precise than digital protocols.

Q: How do you choose a protocol for a sensor?
A: Based on sensor output type, speed requirement, accuracy, and system scalability.

Q: Can ESP32 handle multiple protocols at the same time?
A: Yes. ESP32 supports ADC, GPIO, I2C, SPI, and multiple UART interfaces simultaneously.
