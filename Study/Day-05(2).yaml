## 🔹 CPU and ALU

### CPU (Central Processing Unit)
- Executes program instructions
- Controls system operations

### ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)
- Performs arithmetic operations
- Performs logical comparisons

📌 **Interview Line**  
> The ALU is responsible for arithmetic and logical operations inside the CPU.

## 🔹 GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output)

GPIO pins allow ESP32 to interact with external devices.

### GPIO Modes
| Mode | Description |
|----|------------|
| INPUT | Reads digital signals |
| OUTPUT | Sends digital signals |
| INPUT_PULLUP | Stabilizes floating inputs |

### Smart Home Examples
- Motion sensor input
- Relay control
- Button input

## 🔹 Analog vs Digital Signals

### Digital Signal
- Binary (0 or 1)
- ON/OFF states

### Analog Signal
- Continuous voltage values
- Range: 0V – 3.3V

---

## 🔹 ADC (Analog to Digital Converter)

ADC converts analog voltage into a digital value.

### Why ADC is Required
- Sensors output analog voltages
- ESP32 processes digital data

### Smart Home Examples
- Gas sensor
- Light sensor
- Temperature sensor (analog)

📌 **Interview Line**  
> ADC enables microcontrollers to read analog sensor values.

---

## 🔹 PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)

PWM allows control of power using digital signals.

### Applications
- LED brightness control
- Fan speed control
- Motor control

### Smart Home Examples
- Light dimming
- Fan speed adjustment

📌 **Interview Line**  
> PWM controls output power by varying the duty cycle.

## 🔹 ESP32 Pin Considerations

- Not all GPIO pins support ADC
- Some pins are input-only
- Some pins affect boot mode

📌 Always check ESP32 pinout before use.
