### Example: Temperature Sensor
1. Sensor reads temperature
2. ESP32 processes data
3. Value is formatted
4. Display shows the output

📌 This process is part of **data routing** inside the system.

## 🔹 Display in Smart Home Systems

Even with mobile apps:
- Displays provide local monitoring
- Useful during network failure
- Helpful for debugging

📌 **Interview Insight**  
> Displays act as a local and fail-safe interface in smart home systems.

## 🔹 Display Update Strategy

### ❌ Poor Practice
- Continuous screen updates
- Causes flicker and CPU load

### ✅ Good Practice
- Update only when values change
- Use refresh intervals

📌 Shows efficient embedded system design.

## 🔹 Relation to ModuSense Home Project

- OLED shows sensor values
- Confirms sensor detection
- Displays system status
- Works as local debug interface

---

## ✅ Self-Check

- [ ] I understand display types
- [ ] I know which protocol each display uses
- [ ] I understand data flow to displays
- [ ] I can explain display choice in interviews

## 🧠 Key Takeaway
> Displays enhance usability and provide real-time system feedback in embedded systems.
