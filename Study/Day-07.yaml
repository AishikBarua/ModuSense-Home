### Responsibilities
- UI: Displays sensor data
- ViewModel: Handles logic and state
- Network Layer: Handles communication
- Device Manager: Manages ESP32 devices

---

## 🔹 App Navigation Structure

Suggested screens:
- Device List
- Add Device (+ button)
- Connectivity Selection (BLE / Wi-Fi)
- Sensor Dashboard
- Device Settings

📌 This structure supports modular device management.

---

## 🔹 Device Discovery & Pairing

### BLE-Based Discovery
- App scans nearby ESP32 devices
- User selects device
- Secure pairing is established

📌 BLE is used mainly for first-time setup.

---

## 🔹 ESP32 ↔ Android Communication (API Concept)

### What is an API?
An API defines how the app and ESP32 exchange data.

### Example API Endpoints
- `/sensors/list`
- `/sensor/read?id=temperature`
- `/device/status`

📌 Communication is request-response based.

---

## 🔹 Data Flow
ESP32 → API → Android App → UI


### Visualization
- Numeric values
- Status indicators
- Alert messages

---

## 🔹 Security Basics

Basic security concepts:
- Device authentication
- Secure pairing
- Protected Wi-Fi credentials
- Token-based access

📌 Conceptual understanding is sufficient for beginner level.

---

## 🔹 Role in ModuSense Home Project

- BLE for discovery
- Wi-Fi for control
- API-based communication
- Modular UI design
- Multi-device support

---
