# Day 12 — Project Documentation & Architecture Design

## 🎯 Objective

The objective of Day 12 was to design and document the **overall system architecture** of the project before implementing hardware and firmware.  
This step ensures clarity, scalability, and maintainability of the system.

## 🧠 Why Documentation First?

Professional embedded systems are **designed before coding**.  
Documentation helps to:
- Understand data flow
- Define responsibilities of modules
- Reduce future design errors
- Improve collaboration and maintainability
